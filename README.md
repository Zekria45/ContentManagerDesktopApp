# ContentManagerDesktopApp

This is a desktop app that serves to solve the problem of workers who are out on the field who need to take pictures for documentation purposes. These workers takes pictures and end up coming back to the office without remembering details or other important information about the picture they took. An example would be a real estate seller would see a hole in the basement wall and is told by the owner there is mold. The individual would take a picture for documentation purposes but may forget about the mold. This is the 2nd part of the 2 part project. This desktop app pulls uploaded pictures from a dropbox and displays it on the desktop app with appropriate comments made. Part one will be made in a future project that allows uploading pictures from your phone with comments/notes about the picutre.
